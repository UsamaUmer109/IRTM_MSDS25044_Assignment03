Heading: Imran asks India to play positive role for bilateral seri
Article: ISLAMABAD: Former skipper Imran Khan has asked India to play a positive role for ensuring a bilateral cricket series between their country and Pakistan. Talking to BBC the former world cup winning captain said that a bilateral cricket series between the two neighbouring countries was very important. A cricket series between the two countries will be a great affair. This will benefit cricket boards of both, he said.Imran Khan, however, said that as the Board of Control for Cricket in India(BCCI) was already financially stable, a series would be more beneficial for Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). The PCB may spend money earned through this way to improve its domestic cricket, he said.He said Pakistan always showed a positive attitude for bilateral series and took steps for that but India did not respond positively.Khan said India was a large country and there was an element of arrogance in its attitude, adding this factor was a hurdle in the way of a series.Expressing disappointment at the national team s loss against India in Word T20 game, he said Pakistan team did not do justice with their talent. If they had suffered defeat while fighting there would have been no disappointment, but it is regrettable they lost in a one sided affair, he said.
